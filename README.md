This project contains a curated set of SQL exercises designed to demonstrate intermediate-level proficiency in MySQL. 
It covers essential database programming concepts including triggers, stored procedures, cursors, and user-defined functions, 
organized into four sections. Each task is practical and reflects real-world scenarios involving employee and sales data.

Sections Overview

Section A: Triggers
Prevent Invalid Sales Entries

A BEFORE INSERT trigger on the sales table that blocks any attempt to insert a sale with a zero or negative amount.

Uses SIGNAL SQLSTATE to raise a custom error message.

Salary Change Audit

An AFTER UPDATE trigger on the employees table that logs salary changes into a salary_audit table.

Captures old and new salary values, along with employee details and timestamp.

Section B: Cursors
Employee Listing Procedure

A cursor-based stored procedure that loops through all employees and displays their emp_id and first_name.

Implements a CONTINUE HANDLER for graceful loop termination.

Total Salary Calculation

A cursor-based procedure that calculates the total salary of all employees.

Accumulates salary values into a variable and displays the final result.

Section D: Functions
Employee Tenure in Months

A function that returns the number of months an employee has worked since their hire date.

Uses TIMESTAMPDIFF for precise calculation.

Annual Bonus Calculation

A function that calculates a bonus equal to 10% of an employee‚Äôs salary.

Useful for payroll and performance reward systems.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
